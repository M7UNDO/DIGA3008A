      <h2>Setting Up GitHub and Publishing to Pages</h2>
        <p>
       Since I had already used GitHub before, setting up and publishing to GitHub was a straightforward process for me, as I quickly familiarised myself with everything and was able to push my website without much of a hassle.

     <h2>Reflection on the readings I selected, and relating it to my experience with the internet today</h2>
        <p>
        My chosen reading, The Library of Babel imagined a universe containing every book in the world, whether meaningful or not.
        Today, that universe fits in my pocket; my smartphone gives me access to infinite knowledge at the click of a button.
        The search for truth in Borges' The Library of Babel mirrors how I interact with the internet on a daily basis. However, there is one key difference. Instead of wandering through endless hexagonal rooms, I simply tap on a screen, 
        and my phone connects me to nearly all recorded human knowledge. Whether I'm Googling for academic sources, checking and scrolling social media, or using AI for quick summaries, my phone functions as my own personal library.
        Today we are constantly bombarded with information, but in Borges' time, seeking knowledge was a slow and painstaking process (Borges, 2013).

        The irony of having infinite information at my fingertips doesn't always translate to a deeper understanding. In the same way that Borges' librarians searched for a book that could explain everything, I do the same when I use Google to find answers.
        However, in a world where any information I am searching for is readily available, the true skill isn't just searching but knowing what to trust, what to question, and when to take a break from the never-ending flow of information.

     <h2>Interesting things I found about the history of the web</h2>
       <p>
        Initially, when Wikipedia launched in 2001, it was originally planned to be a side project for Nupedia, which was a more conventional 
        online encyclopaedia that was reviewed by experts. However, Wikipedia became one of the most visited websites in the world due to its 
        open editing style that allows Wikipedia users to edit without needing any formal training.
        Another interesting thing I have discovered about the history of the web includes how search engines have evolved over time.
        Prior to the invention of Google, there was Archie, which was created in 1990 and used to index FTP files. 
        This was among the first attempts at assisting people in finding information on the internet. Search engines that followed this included 
        Yahoo! and AltaVista, which also contributed towards the development of the current digital information landscape.
        It was not until 1998 that Google emerged and introduced it's PageRank algorithm, which innovated and paved the way for how we find information on the internet.

     <h2>My goals for this course</h2>
      <p>
       I'm very hopeful for this course. I'm excited for the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. 
       My main goals for this course are to build a solid foundation in web development and honing my UI and UX design skills 
       to produce visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces, as well as a portfolio of engaging websites.
