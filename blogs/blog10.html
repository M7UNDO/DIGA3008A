            <h2>How can I approach justice and ethics in my artistic and programming practice?</h2>
            <p>
              When thinking about how I can approach justice and ethics in both my artistic and programming practice, I
              believe it's essential to be intentional about embedding values throughout the entire design process.
              Drawing inspiration from Values at Play: Design Tradeoffs in Socially Oriented Game Design (2005) by
              Flanagan et al., I've come to understand that justice and ethics are not just design goals, they're core
              considerations that shape how and why we create.
            </p>
            <p>
              In both web development and game design I follow an iterative process constantly updating, testing, and
              reflecting on each iteration. In terms of game design, playtesting sessions help understand how players
              interact with my game, mechanics, and characters. I use these sessions to ask important questions, like is
              the experience inclusive for all kinds of players with different kinds of playstyles? Does the game
              effectively introduce players to the mechanics? Does the game encourage healthy or too much competition?
              Theses reflections allow me to stay aligned with the values like fairness, accessibility and diversity
              within my games.
            </p>
            <p>
              In web development the iteration process feels different, but it is just as active. I experiment with
              different layouts and interaction styles and committing the versions I want users to engage with. I rely
              on these tests to ensure that my website supports values like trust, accessibly and clarity. The ethical
              challenges are different but just as important. One of the most practical ways I apply justice is by
              making sure all my pages on my website are accessible. This means applying semantic HTML wherever I can so
              screen readers can navigate through my content efficiently, I also make sure I use high contrast colour
              schemes for visibility and use relative units like rem for more responsive design in order to respect user
              preferences. These are not just technical best practices. They are intentional ethical choices that
              attempt to acknowledge the fact that not everyone use the web the same way, so my design choices can
              either include or exclude people .
            </p>

            <p>
              I also try to make a point of avoiding dark patterns, that manipulate my users into doing things, like
              accidentally signing up for emails or making purchases they didn't mean to. In current and future design,
              I want to remain committed to staying away from these patterns in order to create websites that are honest
              and give user control of what they want to with their experience.
