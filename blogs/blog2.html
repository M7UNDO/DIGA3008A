            <h2>
              Reflection on—You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of' Media—Moulthrop, S. and how it
              speaks to the internet today
            </h2>

            <p>
              Moulthrop's work remains a relevant critique of today's internet. Through his exploration of hypertext, he
              questioned how it would potentially change society and the media as we knew it. Moulthrop argued that
              while hypertext promised decentralisation and interaction, the reality would be shaped by corporate
              dominance and traditional models of broadcasting. As I consider how much the internet has developed, his
              insights seem almost prophetic; it is evident that concerns about corporate control and mass consumption
              have come true, as what was initially envisioned as an open, user-driven space has become largely
              controlled by major platforms like Google and Facebook (Meta), much like how television networks
              centralised media consumption before.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through applying McLuhan's media framework to hypertext, Moulthrop argued that although hypertext was
              expected to replace books, it was meant to function more as an alternative to television and change the
              way that people consumed and produced content. Fast forward to today, where social media platforms,
              streaming platforms, and interactive digital spaces like online multiplayer games extend this same
              pattern. Offering users interaction within a structured and often corporate-controlled system.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hypertext's initial promise was that it would be open so that users could create freely, link, and explore
              information in a participatory, non-linear manner. This is a vision that reflects the early days of the
              internet, where independent websites, blogs, and online forums thrived. Although Ted Nelson's idea of a
              democratic, user-driven information system was mirrored in the early days of the internet, it has since
              evolved to become a digital space where users consume content through centralised, algorithm-driven feeds.
              Moulthrop's prediction that the dream of an open hypertext universe would turn into a new form of top-down
              information control and information management is reflected in the corporate control of digital spaces.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, Moulthrop suggests that when media is pushed to its limits, it tends to reverse, meaning that
              even the participatory platforms are susceptible to being homogenised and controlled. A good example of
              this can be seen with the rise of AI-driven content curation on today's internet.

            <ul class="blog-list">
              <li>
                Separation of different types of content: I wanted to ensure that each major content type (blogs,
                portfolios, designs, essays, images, and styles) was stored in its own directory. This ensures ease of
                access and maintains clarity
              </li>
              <li>
                Easy to Scale: The structure allows me to expand my site without cluttering the root directory. New
                content can easily be added without disrupting the structure (e.g. a new blog post would be added to the
                blog post folder)
              </li>
              <li>
                User-friendly URLs: By ensuring my folder structure is logical, my URLs are clean and easy to read. This
                can improve search engine optimisation when navigating through the site, so both users and search
                engines benefit from structured URLs

            <h2>Reflection on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to me</h2>
            <p>
              In my understanding, interaction is about responsiveness, structured unpredictability, user effort, and
              transformation. The system that the user interacts with shouldn't dictate the user's action nor be
              entirely at the mercy of the user; it should respond in a way that is neither completely random nor fully
              predetermined.When users are on the World Wide Web, this idea can manifest through user inputs such as
              clicking, scrolling, or typing, which trigger outputs that modify the information that is displayed on
              their screen. However, not all interactions hold the same weight. Some interactions simply react to an
              input, while others transform content in a meaningful way. Understanding this distinction enables us as
              designers to create experiences that shape, direct, or even subvert user engagement to create meaning or
              challenge conventional ways of engagement.
