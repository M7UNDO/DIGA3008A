     <h2>Reflection on—You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of' Media—Moulthrop, S. and how it speaks to the internet today</h2>
   
      <p>

      Moulthrop's work remains a relevant critique of today's internet. Through his exploration of hypertext, 
      he questioned how it would potentially change society and the media as we knew it. Moulthrop argued that while 
      hypertext promised decentralisation and interaction, the reality would be shaped by corporate dominance and traditional 
      models of broadcasting. As I consider how much the internet has developed, his insights seem almost prophetic; 
      it is evident that concerns about corporate control and mass consumption have come true, as what was initially envisioned 
      as an open, user-driven space has become largely controlled by major platforms like Google and Facebook (Meta), 
      much like how television networks centralised media consumption before.

      </p>

      <p>
     Through applying McLuhan's media framework to hypertext, Moulthrop argued that although hypertext was expected to 
     replace books, it was meant to function more as an alternative to television and change the way that people consumed 
     and produced content. Fast forward to today, where social media platforms, streaming platforms, and interactive 
     digital spaces like online multiplayer games extend this same pattern. Offering users interaction within a structured 
     and often corporate-controlled system.
      </p>
  
      <p>
      Hypertext's initial promise was that it would be open so that users could create freely, link, and explore 
      information in a participatory, non-linear manner. This is a vision that reflects the early days of the internet, where 
      independent websites, blogs, and online forums thrived. Although Ted Nelson's idea of a democratic,
      user-driven information system was mirrored in the early days of the internet, it has since evolved to become a 
      digital space where users consume content through centralised, algorithm-driven feeds. Moulthrop's prediction that 
      the dream of an open hypertext universe would turn into a new form of top-down information control and information 
      management is reflected in the corporate control of digital spaces.
      </p>

      <p>
      Finally, Moulthrop suggests that when media is pushed to its limits, it tends to reverse, meaning that even the 
      participatory platforms are susceptible to being homogenised and controlled. A good example of this can be
      seen with the rise of AI-driven content curation on today's internet.

     <h2>Decision-Making behind my Structure</h2>

        <ul>
           
          <li>Separation of different types of content: I wanted to ensure that each major content type (blogs, portfolios, designs, essays, images, and styles) was stored in its own directory. This ensures ease of access and maintains clarity</li>
          <li>Easy to Scale: The structure allows me to expand my site without cluttering the root directory. New content can easily be added without disrupting the structure (e.g. a new blog post would be added to the blog post folder)</li>
          <li>User-friendly URLs: By ensuring my folder structure is logical, my URLs are clean and easy to read. This can improve search engine optimisation when navigating through the site, so both users and search engines benefit from structured URLs</li>
        </ul>

     <h2>Websites that inspired me:</h2>

        </ul>
   
        <h2>Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?</h2>
        <p>
            In my understanding, interaction is about responsiveness, structured unpredictability, user effort,
            and transformation. The system that the user interacts with shouldn't dictate the user's action nor 
            be entirely at the mercy of the user; it should respond in a way that is neither completely random 
            nor fully predetermined.When users are on the World Wide Web, this idea can manifest through
            user inputs such as clicking,
            scrolling, or typing, which trigger outputs that modify the information that is displayed on their screen. 
            However, not all interactions hold the same weight. Some interactions simply react to an input, while others
            transform content in a meaningful way. Understanding this distinction enables us as designers to create
            experiences that shape, direct, or even subvert user engagement to create meaning or challenge conventional
            ways of engagement.
