            <h2>Blog 3 Title</h2>
            <h3>User Alignment:</h3>
                <p>
                    My goal for this website is to showcase my game development and art projects in an engaging 
                    and intuitive way that allows my potential employers and fellow developers to easily navigate
                    through my website and understand who I am, my skills, and my experience. This means I need 
                    to ensure that my site is easily accessible, clear, and well-structured, with a good interaction
                    flow that allows users to seamlessly explore my work. I also want my interface to immediately 
                    communicate the purpose of my website so users can learn more about me and get in touch if they
                    are interested. My target audience is people within the game and web development industries who 
                    are on the website to engage with my past projects and learn about me in order to consider me for
                    professional positions.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Content, experience, and interface mapping</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Interface elements</li>
                    <li>Site Content</li>
                    <li>User Experience</li>
                </ol>
    
                <h3>Interface elements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigation Bar: A navigation bar should be present on every page, ensuring quick access to different
                     pages such as Home, Blogs, Essays, Portfolio, Design, and About.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>CTA (Call to Action) Buttons: Buttons that prompt user actions like “Read more” will be used on my blog
                        and essay pages below a preview of the writing piece, and buttons like explore will be used on my home
                         page to encourage users to explore the pages.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>Slider: On every scrollable page (Blog, Essay, Portfolio, and Design Page), a slider will be present, 
                        allowing users to navigate through the content dynamically without overwhelming the user with too much
                         information on a page.
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Site Content</h3>
                <p>
                    The content of my website will be structured in a way that ensures users find the information that they need
                    quickly and efficiently. My home page would function as the landing page, welcoming the user, introducing me,
                    and guiding users to explore either my blogs, essays, design process, or my portfolio page. I will also include
                    an about me page that details my skills and my experience, giving users some insight into my background. 
                    My blog page would consist of a collection of my weekly blogs with short previews of the blog to draw
                    the attention of the users. My portfolio page would showcase a collection of my game development projects, 
                    each with a cover image, a short description of the game, and a link to play the game, whereas the art section
                    would display some of my artworks in a grid fashion, enabling users to view the works.
                </p>
    
                <h3>User Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    The user experience on my website should feel engaging, seamless, and intuitive. Users should naturally be guided
                    from one section to the next. When users visit my website, they should immediately understand it's purpose and
                    have clear options to explore. Throughout the experience of exploring my website, elements like smooth 
                    transitions and responsive design will ensure that the process of navigation feels fluid and accessible across 
                    all devices
                </p>
    
                <h3>Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme and how it relates to semantic markup:</h3>
                <p>
                    Through working on this exercise, I started to see how my website's structure and URL scheme are essential for 
                    ensuring accessibility, clarity, and easy use. By organising my website's content into defined sections, such
                    as Home, Blog, Portfolio, Essays, and Design, I am able to maintain a logical flow that makes the process of
                    navigation seamless. This feeds into my URL scheme, which needs to be clean and hierarchal to ensure usability.
                    For example, a game development project should be accessed via mywebsite.com/portfolio/project1.html,
                    making it clear what content will be on that page. This goes hand in hand with semantic markup, which enhances
                    the meaning of my website's content, ensuring my website is structured in a way that is easy for search engines
                    to interpret. Using tags like &lt;nav&gt; for navigation links and &lt;section&gt; to for different areas of my content
                    improves my search engine optimization and my user experience.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Reflecting on this week's progress</h3>
                <p>
                    This week my goal was to refine my folder structure and add navigation to my site, as I previously didn't have 
                    a way for users to navigate through different pages. In order to implement this, I added a navigation bar that 
                    remains consistent on all my pages, ensuring that users can access different areas of the website without 
                    feeling lost. On the technical side, I also focused on my semantic markup, ensuring that tags like &lt;nav&gt;
                    and &lt;section&gt; are used correctly to improve accessibility and optimisation for search engines.
                </p>
