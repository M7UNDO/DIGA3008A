            <h2>User Alignment</h2>
            <p>
              My goal for this website is to showcase my game development and art projects in an engaging and intuitive
              way that allows my potential employers and fellow developers to easily navigate through my website and
              understand who I am, my skills, and my experience. This means I need to ensure that my site is easily
              accessible, clear, and well-structured, with a good interaction flow that allows users to seamlessly
              explore my work. I also want my interface to immediately communicate the purpose of my website so users
              can learn more about me and get in touch if they are interested. My target audience is people within the
              game and web development industries who are on the website to engage with my past projects and learn about
              me in order to consider me for professional positions.

            <h3>Interface elements</h3>
            <ul class="blog-list">
              <li>
                Navigation Bar: A navigation bar should be present on every page, ensuring quick access to different
                pages such as Home, Blogs, Essays, Portfolio, Design, and About.
              </li>

              <li>
                CTA (Call to Action) Buttons: Buttons that prompt user actions like “Read more” will be used on my blog
                and essay pages below a preview of the writing piece, and buttons like explore will be used on my home
                page to encourage users to explore the pages.
              </li>

              <li>
                Slider: On every scrollable page (Blog, Essay, Portfolio, and Design Page), a slider will be present,
                allowing users to navigate through the content dynamically without overwhelming the user with too much
                information on a page.

            <h3>Site Content</h3>
            <p>
              The content of my website will be structured in a way that ensures users find the information that they
              need quickly and efficiently. My home page would function as the landing page, welcoming the user,
              introducing me, and guiding users to explore either my blogs, essays, design process, or my portfolio
              page. I will also include an about me page that details my skills and my experience, giving users some
              insight into my background. My blog page would consist of a collection of my weekly blogs with short
              previews of the blog to draw the attention of the users. My portfolio page would showcase a collection of
              my game development projects, each with a cover image, a short description of the game, and a link to play
              the game, whereas the art section would display some of my artworks in a grid fashion, enabling users to
              view the works.

            <h3>User Experience</h3>
            <p>
              The user experience on my website should feel engaging, seamless, and intuitive. Users should naturally be
              guided from one section to the next. When users visit my website, they should immediately understand it's
              purpose and have clear options to explore. Throughout the experience of exploring my website, elements
              like smooth transitions and responsive design will ensure that the process of navigation feels fluid and
              accessible across all devices

              Reflecting on how the exercise above relates to what you know about my structure and URL scheme and how it
              relates to semantic markup:
            </h2>

            <p>
              Through working on this exercise, I started to see how my website's structure and URL scheme are essential
              for ensuring accessibility, clarity, and easy use. By organising my website's content into defined
              sections, such as Home, Blog, Portfolio, Essays, and Design, I am able to maintain a logical flow that
              makes the process of navigation seamless. This feeds into my URL scheme, which needs to be clean and
              hierarchal to ensure usability. For example, a game development project should be accessed via
              mywebsite.com/portfolio/project1.html, making it clear what content will be on that page. This goes hand
              in hand with semantic markup, which enhances the meaning of my website's content, ensuring my website is
              structured in a way that is easy for search engines to interpret. Using tags like &lt;nav&gt; for
              navigation links and &lt;section&gt; to for different areas of my content improves my search engine
              optimization and my user experience.

            <h2>Reflecting on this week's progress</h2>
            <p>
              This week my goal was to refine my folder structure and add navigation to my site, as I previously didn't
              have a way for users to navigate through different pages. In order to implement this, I added a navigation
              bar that remains consistent on all my pages, ensuring that users can access different areas of the website
              without feeling lost. On the technical side, I also focused on my semantic markup, ensuring that tags like
              &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;section&gt; are used correctly to improve accessibility and optimisation for search
              engines.
