            <h2>Reflection on how my original wireframes hold up in line with the IXD process</h2>
            <p>
              The process of creating my website from when I started up until now has relatively been smooth, with some
              bumps along the way. I'm way more comfortable with understanding and writing HTML code, as I've grasped
              most of the foundational elements. As I continue to build my site, I feel more confident in my vision for
              my website, which includes my structuring and placement of different elements to create a functional
              website.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <h2>What I'm most proud of?</h2>
            <p>
              At this point, I'm most proud of my folder structure and how I've organised and laid out the foundation of
              my website, using best practices and applying concepts like semantic markup and microformats to my site.
              Additionally, I think I have made important considerations in my wireframes, like user experience and
              responsive/interactive design (e.g., a consistent navigation menu), and once I add styling to the website,
              everything will come together as I had envisioned it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <h2>What I struggled with?</h2>
            <p>
              A challenge that I faced early was not being able to fully wrap my head around the use of semantic tags,
              specifically in knowing where to use them and how frequently I should make use of them. This was due to
              not understanding their individual purpose, and after home research and guidance, I was able to resolve
              this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I struggled with most was getting my deployment pages to work, as my live site would be perfectly
              fine in line with the code I had written and everything I had done, but when pushing to GitHub and opening
              my changes in the deployment pages, I constantly encountered 404 errors, which caused my pages to crash or
              not load. After doing some extensive research and reaching out for assistance, I was able to solve this
              problem.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <h2>What I want to change going forward?</h2>
            <p>
              Going forward, I want to make the website more interactive and more visually engaging for users by
              incorporating CSS and JavaScript elements like styling, animations, and smooth transitions, and I want to
              maintain a balance between design that is aesthetically pleasing yet responsive and well thought out.
