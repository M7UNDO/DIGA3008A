        <h3>
          Reflection on how my original wireframes hold up in line with the IXD
          process
        </h3>
        <p>
          The process of creating my website from when I started up until now
          has relatively been smooth, with some bumps along the way. I'm way
          more comfortable with understanding and writing HTML code, as I've
          grasped most of the foundational elements. As I continue to build my
          site, I feel more confident in my vision for my website, which
          includes my structuring and placement of different elements to create
          a functional website.
        </p>

        <h3>What I'm most proud of?</h3>
        <p>
          At this point, I'm most proud of my folder structure and how I've
          organised and laid out the foundation of my website, using best
          practices and applying concepts like semantic markup and microformats
          to my site. Additionally, I think I have made important considerations
          in my wireframes, like user experience and responsive/interactive
          design (e.g., a consistent navigation menu), and once I add styling to
          the website, everything will come together as I had envisioned it.
        </p>
        <h3>What I struggled with?</h3>
        <p>
          A challenge that I faced early was not being able to fully wrap my
          head around the use of semantic tags, specifically in knowing where to
          use them and how frequently I should make use of them. This was due to
          not understanding their individual purpose, and after home research
          and guidance, I was able to resolve this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I struggled with most was getting my deployment pages to work, as
          my live site would be perfectly fine in line with the code I had
          written and everything I had done, but when pushing to GitHub and
          opening my changes in the deployment pages, I constantly encountered
          404 errors, which caused my pages to crash or not load. After doing
          some extensive research and reaching out for assistance, I was able to
          solve this problem.
        </p>
        <h3>What I want to change going forward?</h3>
        <p>
          Going forward, I want to make the website more interactive and more
          visually engaging for users by incorporating CSS and JavaScript
          elements like styling, animations, and smooth transitions, and I want
          to maintain a balance between design that is aesthetically pleasing
          yet responsive and well thought out.
