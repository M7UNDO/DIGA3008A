            <h2>Spyros Kasapis - Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic</h2>
            <p>
              This article really made me think about how intertwined internet access has become with everyday life and
              how unfair and unjust it is that so many people are still left out due to access. Kasapis makes a
              compelling argument for why internet access is not just a luxury or convenience; it should be a
              fundamental right that should be guaranteed to everyone, not just a tool that supports the rights of some
              people.
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID pandemic really highlighted this, as some of us were attending classes on Teams or Zoom, whereas
              others were completely cut off, especially in low-income communities like rural areas or townships. It's
              crazy to think about the fact that a significant portion of the world is still offline in 2025. According
              to the ITU, that number was 2.9 billion people as recently as 2021. This is more than a “digital divide”;
              it's a digital cliff. Another thing that stuck out for me in this article was the irony of tech
              billionaires raking in large profits while there are so many who still can't afford data to this day. Jeff
              Bezos grew his wealth astronomically during the period of COVID due to the increase in online shopping,
              while there were millions of people who could not access even the most basic digital resources. This is a
              reminder that the internet can be both a tool for equity or a force that can deepen divides and inequality
              , depending on the way that it is governed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This leads me to the question posed by Kasapis but doesn't really address: Who should be responsible for
              making access to the internet something universal? Should it be the government? Private businesses like
              Vodacom? NGOs? I believe it can be managed akin to how we handle public utilities, such as water and
              electricity. This means making internet access something that is accessible and affordable to everyone by
              regulating unfair data costs as well as digital monopolies. Since there is a right to education and
              education relies on the internet, then internet access should also be a right. However, access alone is
              not enough. The article. However, access alone is not enough. The article could've also explored digital
              surveillance or data exploitation. In our current digital age, just because someone is able to go online,
              it does not mean that they're safe or empowered. For instance, kids using social media without protection.
              Access to the internet should also come with protections in place, as well as digital literacy.

            <h2>Maria Tataki & Dimitris Glynos - Digital Inclusion: Digital Divide Widens</h2>
            <p>
              At this point, I'm most proud of my folder structure and how I've organised and laid out the foundation of
              my website, using best practices and applying concepts like semantic markup and microformats to my site.
              Additionally, I think I have made important considerations in my wireframes, like user experience and
              responsive/interactive design (e.g., a consistent navigation menu), and once I add styling to the website,
              everything will come together as I had envisioned it.

            <h2>What I struggled with?</h2>
            <p>
              A challenge that I faced early was not being able to fully wrap my head around the use of semantic tags,
              specifically in knowing where to use them and how frequently I should make use of them. This was due to
              not understanding their individual purpose, and after home research and guidance, I was able to resolve
              this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I struggled with most was getting my deployment pages to work, as my live site would be perfectly
              fine in line with the code I had written and everything I had done, but when pushing to GitHub and opening
              my changes in the deployment pages, I constantly encountered 404 errors, which caused my pages to crash or
              not load. After doing some extensive research and reaching out for assistance, I was able to solve this
              problem.
            </p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <h2>What I want to change going forward?</h2>
            <p>
              Going forward, I want to make the website more interactive and more visually engaging for users by
              incorporating CSS and JavaScript elements like styling, animations, and smooth transitions, and I want to
              maintain a balance between design that is aesthetically pleasing yet responsive and well thought out.
