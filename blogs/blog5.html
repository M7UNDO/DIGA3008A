            <h2>Spyros Kasapis - Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic</h2>
            <p>
              This article really made me think about how intertwined internet access has become with everyday life and
              how unfair and unjust it is that so many people are still left out due to access. Kasapis makes a
              compelling argument for why internet access is not just a luxury or convenience; it should be a
              fundamental right that should be guaranteed to everyone, not just a tool that supports the rights of some
              people.
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID pandemic really highlighted this, as some of us were attending classes on Teams or Zoom, whereas
              others were completely cut off, especially in low-income communities like rural areas or townships. It's
              crazy to think about the fact that a significant portion of the world is still offline in 2025. According
              to the ITU, that number was 2.9 billion people as recently as 2021. This is more than a “digital divide”;
              it's a digital cliff. Another thing that stuck out for me in this article was the irony of tech
              billionaires raking in large profits while there are so many who still can't afford data to this day. Jeff
              Bezos grew his wealth astronomically during the period of COVID due to the increase in online shopping,
              while there were millions of people who could not access even the most basic digital resources. This is a
              reminder that the internet can be both a tool for equity or a force that can deepen divides and inequality
              , depending on the way that it is governed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This leads me to the question posed by Kasapis but doesn't really address: Who should be responsible for
              making access to the internet something universal? Should it be the government? Private businesses like
              Vodacom? NGOs? I believe it can be managed akin to how we handle public utilities, such as water and
              electricity. This means making internet access something that is accessible and affordable to everyone by
              regulating unfair data costs as well as digital monopolies. Since there is a right to education and
              education relies on the internet, then internet access should also be a right. However, access alone is
              not enough. The article. However, access alone is not enough. The article could've also explored digital
              surveillance or data exploitation. In our current digital age, just because someone is able to go online,
              it does not mean that they're safe or empowered. For instance, kids using social media without protection.
              Access to the internet should also come with protections in place, as well as digital literacy.

            <h2>Maria Tataki & Dimitris Glynos - Digital Inclusion: Digital Divide Widens</h2>
            <p>
              This article revealed how deep the digital divide actually runs, and COVID-19 did not just expose
              inequalities. It amplified them. Tataki and Glynos provide an excellent analysis of the pandemic
              essentially pushing society further into a digital-first world. It also points out that only a privileged
              few were ready for that shift while the rest were left behind. A statistic that really stood out to me was
              that over 830 million learners globally didn't have access to a computer, while 40% of learners did not
              have access to the internet in their homes. Although this statistic was not shocking to me, it's crazy to
              think about, as it shows us how many students were simply expected to continue their education online
              without even having the basic tools to do so. This divide was most evident in townships and rural areas
              where large numbers of students wouldn't have been able to join Teams or Zoom meetings because they did
              not have access to internet, data, devices or connections that were required, even for simple things that
              are overlooked in everyday life, like electricity to consistently charge their phones. This was the case
              globally; UNESCO even confirms this digital gap is hitting those who are most vulnerable, like learners
              from low-income homes.
            </p>

            <p>
              The authors of this article highlighted some short-term solutions that were implemented in different
              countries, like the UK, where laptops were provided for those in need, or in Egypt, where free SIM cards
              were provided. I think calling these temporary solutions appropriate, as giving someone a few gigs of data
              during a pandemic won't fix decades of digital exclusion. What's necessary is more long-term
              infrastructure and changes of policy that include affordable broadband, digital skills training, and
              support for home learning environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think that this article did an excellent job connecting education to employment, as the digital divide
              impacted more than just learning; it also had an impact on livelihoods too. For instance, people in
              tech-friendly jobs were easily able to make the switch to working remotely. But what about everyone else?
              McKinsey notes that people without degrees or high-speed internet connections would have been more likely
              to lose their jobs or be exposed to unsafe working conditions. This was a major issue of class and digital
              inequity colliding. Additionally, there are also issues of high data costs. So even if someone technically
              has access, their access may still be low or simply unreliable.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, Tataki and Glynos are absolutely correct: unless we begin to act now and attempt to close the
              digital divide, then the gap between those who are connected and those disconnected will only grow wider.
