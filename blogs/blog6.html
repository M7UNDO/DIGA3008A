            <h2>
              Close Reading of Spyros Kasapis' “Internet Access Is a Fundamental Right. Especially Amidst a Pandemic
            </h2>
            <p>
              Kasapis opens the article by framing internet access within the broader tradition of human rights, drawing
              inspiration from Salvador Allende's claim that happiness and the basic needs that make happiness possible
              are human rights. Internet access is not positioned as a luxury but as an essential requirement for
              achieving dignity, equality, and full participation within a society. By making the connection between
              historical struggles for rights like education and healthcare, the article places internet access on the
              same level of urgency.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core aim of the article is to make the argument that “free internet access should be indispensable to
              all members of a society (Kasapis, 2021). Having no access to the internet means being cut off from
              participating in society, as this restricts access to work, education, healthcare information and broader
              social participation. This is especially the case in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted and
              intensified existing inequalities, as most aspects of our everyday lives shifted online, with companies
              and schools moving operations to platforms like Google Meet, Zoom and Teams (Case, 2020). Without digital
              devices or access to the internet, people were left behind. Students without internet access, fast
              internet speed, or reliable connection did not only lack access to education but also large information
              networks. In many underprivileged-to-participation areas, such as townships and rural areas, limited
              infrastructure became the primary barrier.
            </p>
            <p>
              Poor connectivity, slow internet speeds, and unstable access made it extremely difficult to engage in
              online activities effectively. Measures of social distancing made participating in the digital economy
              something crucial, not optional, as even buying and selling moved online due to the cessation of human
              interaction (Lance Allen Liotta, 2023).
            </p>

            <p>
              The article also highlights the emergence of digital inequality. By using Jeff Bezos' Amazon as an example
              for how capitalism boomed during this time as profits skyrocketed for the company due to an increase in
              online shopping, while half of the world's population still remained offline. This juxtaposition
              demonstrates that without the internet, billions are excluded from opportunities that are essential for
              survival today, such as education, healthcare and economic activities. Kasapis' claim is that our current
              economy denies billions access points to systemic global inequalities, where the internet is becoming as
              necessary as any basic need in our society (Kasapis, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>
              In response to the urgent problem of digital inequality, the article raises important economic and
              political questions: Should all citizens be guaranteed internet access regardless of income? Should
              governments take responsibility for ensuring this right? And who should set the rules for the internet
              itself? Kasapis cautions that without public, private corporations could shape internet rules in ways that
              entrench existing inequalities, pointing us towards a more human rights-based framework that ensures
              fairness and democratic participation online (Kasapis, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>
              Some avenues for future research that could be explored could be: Investigating how digital exclusion can
              amplify existing racial, gender, and economic inequalities Access to the internet is not just a
              technological constraint; it also interacts with various types of marginalisation and digital inequality.
              Examining legal frameworks for internet rights may also be worthwhile in order to establish how
              international human rights laws can evolve to explicitly include internet access and also identify which
              legal precedents (like the Indian Supreme Court ruling) can be leveraged across the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
              In closing, I think the article makes a strong argument for reconsidering internet access as a fundamental
              human right, as opposed to a luxury or privilege. Kasapis effectively emphasises the problem of digital
              inequality, but he does not really suggest concrete models for how governments could provide free access.
              The article could've explored more solid models such as public-private partnerships and satellite
              initiatives to make the argument even stronger.
