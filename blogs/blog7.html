            <h2>A critical of reflection “Digital inequalities and why they matter” by Robinson et al. (2015).</h2>
            <p>
              My chosen reading is “Digital inequalities and why they matter” by Robinson et al. (2015). The article
              argues that digital inequality is not just about having access to technology or the internet, but it is
              also concerned with the quality, autonomy, skills, support, and purposes of digital engagement. Each of
              which reflects the existing broader structural inequalities in society. Before engaging with this reading,
              I had only understood digital inequality in binary terms (those who have internet access and those who do
              not) due to this being the primary discourse that surrounds it. Viewing digital inequality through this
              lens tends to overlook the more nuanced ways that technology intersects with social and economic power.
              Internet access alone is not enough, as having internet access does not automatically mean that someone is
              empowered or included in meaningful ways. This article points out that what matters is how people are
              using digital tools and what social conditions are shaping those uses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Robinson et al. make a compelling argument for digital inequality being closely linked with “life
              outcomes”. This means that due to our current digital age, digital inequality has the power to influence
              things like academic success, employment opportunities, access to health care, and even political
              participation. Reflecting on this perspective helped me better understand how digital skills and patterns
              of engagement have real-world consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, someone who lacks the ability or confidence to navigate digital systems, and also isn't
              encouraged to do so due to their environment, may find themselves excluded from vital opportunities. This
              highlights the fact that digital inequality mirrors pre-existing structural forms of inequality, such as
              race, class and gender. Those who are already marginalised within a society are further excluded , as they
              encounter greater obstacles when it comes to full digital participation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dynamic nature of digital inequality is another critical point that resonated with me. The article
              highlights there are constantly new forms of inequality that emerge not only between those who are online
              and those who are not but also those who benefit economically from digital engagement and those who do
              not. For instance, the widespread use of smartphones can conceal deep divides: while one person may use
              their device only for basic entertainment or messaging, another may leverage it for learning, networking,
              or income generation. This complexity challenges the assumption that closing the access gap is a complete
              solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, Robinson et al. raise some significant concerns for researching and policymaking, critiquing
              studies that solely rely on digital data. This looks past individuals who are less connected. If
              researchers only analyse the behaviour of those who are digitally visible, they risk presenting a skewed
              version of reality. This insight prompted me to think about digital exclusion not just as a social issue
              but also as an epistemological one. When entire groups are absent from datasets, their experiences and
              needs may be ignored in both academic and policy contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The article also made me question my own digital habits too. I hadn't really thought about the fact that
              the way I use technology (researching, building networks, creating content) is a product of privilege.
              It's easy to assume that everyone has the same internet, but this reading made it clear that the internet
              isn't a neutral space; it's shaped by, and helps shape, power and inequality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflecting on Robinson et al.'s article has enhanced my understanding of digital inequality. The article
              exposed the complex layers that often go unnoticed, encouraging me to reconsider simplistic views of
              digital inequity and to adopt a more critical, equity-focused approach when thinking about technology and
              inclusion.
