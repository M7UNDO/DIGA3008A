                  My chosen reading, The Library of Babel imagined a universe containing every book in the world,
                  whether meaningful or not. Today, that universe fits in my pocket; my smartphone gives me access to
                  infinite knowledge at the click of a button. The search for truth in Borges' The Library of Babel
                  mirrors how I interact with the internet on a daily basis. However, there is one key difference.
                  Instead of wandering through endless hexagonal rooms, I simply tap on a screen, and my phone connects
                  me to nearly all recorded human knowledge. Whether I'm Googling for academic sources, checking and
                  scrolling social media, or using AI for quick summaries, my phone functions as my own personal
                  library. Today we are constantly bombarded with information, but in Borges' time, seeking knowledge
                  was a slow and painstaking process (Borges, 2013).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The irony of having infinite information at my fingertips doesn't always translate to a deeper
                  understanding. In the same way that Borges' librarians searched for a book that could explain
                  everything, I do the same when I use Google to find answers. However, in a world where any information
                  I am searching for is readily available, the true skill isn't just searching but knowing what to
                  trust, what to question, and when to take a break from the never-ending flow of information.

              <div class="blog-content">
                <p>
                  Moulthrop's work remains a relevant critique of today's internet. Through his exploration of
                  hypertext, he questioned how it would potentially change society and the media as we knew it.
                  Moulthrop argued that while hypertext promised decentralisation and interaction, the reality would be
                  shaped by corporate dominance and traditional models of broadcasting. As I consider how much the
                  internet has developed, his insights seem almost prophetic; it is evident that concerns about
                  corporate control and mass consumption have come true, as what was initially envisioned as an open,
                  user-driven space has become largely controlled by major platforms like Google and Facebook (Meta),
                  much like how television networks centralised media consumption before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through applying McLuhan's media framework to hypertext, Moulthrop argued that although hypertext was
                  expected to replace books, it was meant to function more as an alternative to television and change
                  the way that people consumed and produced content. Fast forward to today, where social media
                  platforms, streaming platforms, and interactive digital spaces like online multiplayer games extend
                  this same pattern. Offering users interaction within a structured and often corporate-controlled
                  system.

                  My goal for this website is to showcase my game development and art projects in an engaging and
                  intuitive way that allows my potential employers and fellow developers to easily navigate through my
                  website and understand who I am, my skills, and my experience. This means I need to ensure that my
                  site is easily accessible, clear, and well-structured, with a good interaction flow that allows users
                  to seamlessly explore my work. I also want my interface to immediately communicate the purpose of my
                  website so users can learn more about me and get in touch if they are interested. My target audience
                  is people within the game and web development industries who are on the website to engage with my past
                  projects and learn about me in order to consider me for professional positions.

                  The process of creating my website from when I started up until now has relatively been smooth, with
                  some bumps along the way. I'm way more comfortable with understanding and writing HTML code, as I've
                  grasped most of the foundational elements. As I continue to build my site, I feel more confident in my
                  vision for my website, which includes my structuring and placement of different elements to create a
                  functional website.

                <p>
                  At this point, I'm most proud of my folder structure and how I've organised and laid out the
                  foundation of my website, using best practices and applying concepts like semantic markup and
                  microformats to my site. Additionally, I think I have made important considerations in my wireframes,
                  like user experience and responsive/interactive design (e.g., a consistent navigation menu), and once
                  I add styling to the website, everything will come together as I had envisioned it.

                <p>
                  This article really made me think about how intertwined internet access has become with everyday life
                  and how unfair and unjust it is that so many people are still left out due to access. Kasapis makes a
                  compelling argument for why internet access is not just a luxury or convenience; it should be a
                  fundamental right that should be guaranteed to everyone, not just a tool that supports the rights of
                  some people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The COVID pandemic really highlighted this, as some of us were attending classes on Teams or Zoom,
                  whereas others were completely cut off, especially in low-income communities like rural areas or
                  townships. It's crazy to think about the fact that a significant portion of the world is still offline
                  in 2025. According to the ITU, that number was 2.9 billion people as recently as 2021. This is more
                  than a “digital divide”; it's a digital cliff. Another thing that stuck out for me in this article was
                  the irony of tech billionaires raking in large profits while there are so many who still can't afford
                  data to this day. Jeff Bezos grew his wealth astronomically during the period of COVID due to the
                  increase in online shopping, while there were millions of people who could not access even the most
                  basic digital resources. This is a reminder that the internet can be both a tool for equity or a force
                  that can deepen divides and inequality , depending on the way that it is governed.

                  Kasapis opens the article by framing internet access within the broader tradition of human rights,
                  drawing inspiration from Salvador Allende's claim that happiness and the basic needs that make
                  happiness possible are human rights. Internet access is not positioned as a luxury but as an essential
                  requirement for achieving dignity, equality, and full participation within a society. By making the
                  connection between historical struggles for rights like education and healthcare, the article places
                  internet access on the same level of urgency.

              <div class="blog-content">
                <p>
                  My chosen reading is “Digital inequalities and why they matter” by Robinson et al. (2015). The article
                  argues that digital inequality is not just about having access to technology or the internet, but it
                  is also concerned with the quality, autonomy, skills, support, and purposes of digital engagement.
                  Each of which reflects the existing broader structural inequalities in society. Before engaging with
                  this reading, I had only understood digital inequality in binary terms (those who have internet access
                  and those who do not) due to this being the primary discourse that surrounds it. Viewing digital
                  inequality through this lens tends to overlook the more nuanced ways that technology intersects with
                  social and economic power. Internet access alone is not enough, as having internet access does not
                  automatically mean that someone is empowered or included in meaningful ways. This article points out
                  that what matters is how people are using digital tools and what social conditions are shaping those
                  uses.

                <p>
                  When thinking about how my coding practice fits into a decolonial framework, one key thing I've become
                  aware of is whose design conventions I'm centring and who gets excluded by default. Since most web
                  development is shaped by Western-centric design systems, assumptions about user behaviour and
                  accessibility standards don't always reflect local or Global South contexts. As I build my website, I
                  ask myself if it reflects my culture and my community or if it just replicates templates made for
                  someone else's audience.

                <p>
                  In my view, an ethical internet must function as a truly inclusive public sphere, empowering diverse
                  voices, prioritising universal access, fostering meaningful discourse, and resisting the forces of
                  commercialisation and fragmentation. As Papacharissi highlights in “The Virtual Sphere: The Internet
                  as a Public Sphere”, while the internet holds potential to revive public discourse, its current form
                  often replicates and reinforces existing inequalities, creating a virtual space that is dominated by
                  the economically and technologically privileged (Papacharissi 2020:21 ). This reflects Habermas's
                  critique of the bourgeois public sphere, which was traditionally accessible only to property-owning
                  males. Similar to today, disparities in infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy persist,
                  preventing marginalised communities from complete participation, despite the fact that global
                  connectivity has reached 66% (ITU, 2023). An ethical internet must address these gaps through policy
                  interventions(e.g broadband initiatives) and educational programmes that empower people to critically
                  engage with digital content, since access alone is inadequate without the ability to navigate
                  information responsibly (Schement & Curtis, 1997).

                  When thinking about how I can approach justice and ethics in both my artistic and programming
                  practice, I believe it's essential to be intentional about embedding values throughout the entire
                  design process. Drawing inspiration from Values at Play: Design Tradeoffs in Socially Oriented Game
                  Design (2005) by Flanagan et al., I've come to understand that justice and ethics are not just design
                  goals, they're core considerations that shape how and why we create.

                  In both web development and game design I follow an iterative process constantly updating, testing,
                  and reflecting on each iteration. In terms of game design, playtesting sessions help understand how
                  players interact with my game, mechanics, and characters. I use these sessions to ask important
                  questions, like is the experience inclusive for all kinds of players with different kinds of
                  playstyles? Does the game effectively introduce players to the mechanics? Does the game encourage
                  healthy or too much competition? Theses reflections allow me to stay aligned with the values like
                  fairness, accessibility and diversity within my games.
