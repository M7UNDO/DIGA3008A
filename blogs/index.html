                        My chosen reading, The Library of Babel imagined a universe containing every book in the world, whether
                        meaningful or not. Today, that universe fits in my pocket; my smartphone gives me access to infinite
                        knowledge at the click of a button. The search for truth in Borges' The Library of Babel mirrors how I
                        interact with the internet on a daily basis. However, there is one key difference. Instead of wandering
                        through endless hexagonal rooms, I simply tap on a screen, and my phone connects me to nearly all recorded
                        human knowledge. Whether I'm Googling for academic sources, checking and scrolling social media, or using AI
                        for quick summaries, my phone functions as my own personal library. Today we are constantly bombarded with
                        information, but in Borges' time, seeking knowledge was a slow and painstaking process (Borges, 2013).

                      <p>
                        Moulthrop's work remains a relevant critique of today's internet. Through his exploration of hypertext, he
                        questioned how it would potentially change society and the media as we knew it. Moulthrop argued that
                        while hypertext promised decentralisation and interaction, the reality would be shaped by corporate
                        dominance and traditional models of broadcasting. As I consider how much the internet has developed, his
                        insights seem almost prophetic; it is evident that concerns about corporate control and mass consumption
                        have come true, as what was initially envisioned as an open, user-driven space has become largely
                        controlled by major platforms like Google and Facebook (Meta), much like how television networks
                        centralised media consumption before.

                       My goal for this website is to showcase my game development and art projects in an engaging and intuitive
                       way that allows my potential employers and fellow developers to easily navigate through my website and
                       understand who I am, my skills, and my experience. This means I need to ensure that my site is easily
                       accessible, clear, and well-structured, with a good interaction flow that allows users to seamlessly
                       explore my work. I also want my interface to immediately communicate the purpose of my website so users
                       can learn more about me and get in touch if they are interested. My target audience is people within the
                       game and web development industries who are on the website to engage with my past projects and learn about
                       me in order to consider me for professional positions.

                        The process of creating my website from when I started up until now has relatively been smooth, with some
                        bumps along the way. I'm way more comfortable with understanding and writing HTML code, as I've grasped
                        most of the foundational elements. As I continue to build my site, I feel more confident in my vision for
                        my website, which includes my structuring and placement of different elements to create a functional
                        website.
