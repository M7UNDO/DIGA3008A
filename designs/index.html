          <p>
            The target audience for my site includes three key groups. Firstly, potential employers, who are on the
            website to engage with my past projects and learn about me in order to consider me for professional
            positions. Second my peers, fellow developers and people within the industry who may be viewing my work for
            the purpose of potential collaborations or networking opportunities. Lastly users who might be visiting my
            website seeking some inspiration into my design process.
          </p>
          <h4>My content</h4>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>
              My home page will serve as the landing page, welcoming users and providing them with a brief introduction
              of who I am and guiding them to different sections of my website.
            </li>
            <li>My blog page will feature a collection of my weekly blogs.</li>
            <li>My essay page will focus on more academic writing and themes.</li>
            <li>

              artwork. Users can click on a link to play my games and interact directly with my work.
            </li>
            <li>
              My design page provides a behind-the-scenes look at my web development process, allowing users to see the

            <ul class="design-list">
               <li>
                 The design of the website is sleek and futuristic. The black and white colour palette and the bold
                 typography give the site a modern look and feel.
               </li>
               <li>
                 The use of bold typography on different headings helps the website achieve its strong visual hierarchy.
                 This contributes to its easy navigation.
               </li>
               <li>
                 The design of the website is very clean and minimalist. It does a good job of avoiding clutter, allowing
                 the content to stand out.
               </li>
               <li>
                 The way in which the designers' skillset has been displayed on the website effectively outlines their
                 range of skills and projects and showcases the designers' versatility. I think this is a good idea and
                 could attract potential employers.
               </li>
               <li>
                 The way the website makes use of creative typography, such as the fragmented text. This adds an artistic
                 touch to the design.
               </li>
             </ul>

             <h4>Dislikes</h4>
             <ul class="design-list">
                <li>
                  The website's design relies heavily on text; there is a lack of imagery. For the design of my website, I
                  intend to use more images and icons. In this case, however, it does not take away from the website's
                  appeal and impact.
               </li>

               <li>
                The website's design makes use of a limited colour palette. Although the minimalism is a positive for this
                website. Adding some spots of colour could potentially make the website more engaging.

          <h2>Style Guide</h2>
          <h3>Colour Scheme:</h3>
          <h4>Primary Pallete</h4>
          <figure class="pallete-container">
            <img class="pallete" src="images/Colour Pallete 2.png" alt="Colour Palette 2"/>
            <figcaption>
              <p>
                This palette has a natural and earthy vibe, combining deep greens and soft neutrals for a grounded,
                organic look.
              </p>
              <p>Colours: Dark forest green, Soft cream white, Pure black,Muted sage green, calm and natural</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h4>Secondary Palette</h4>
          <figure class="pallete-container">
            <img class="pallete" src="images/Colour Pallete 3.png" alt="Colour Palette 3"/>
            <figcaption>
              <p>This palette leans towards a muted, classic look with calming shades and a sophisticated vibe.</p>
              <p>Colours: Deep navy blue, Soft gray, Warm off-white, Muted warm gray</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h4>Neutral Pallete</h4>
          <figure class="pallete-container">
            <img class="pallete" src="images/Colour Pallete 1.png" alt="Colour Palette 1"/>
            <figcaption>
              <p>
                This palette has a more balanced, and modern feel with a mix of warm and cool tones, it would be ideal
                for the minimalist and contemporary design I am going going for
              </p>
              <p>Colours: Dark charcoal gray, Warm taupe brown, Warm off-white, Neutral gray</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

          <h4>Typography</h4>
          <p>
            I want the typography of my website to have a clean and modern feel. I think this is reflected by my font
            choices below, which are Montserrat, which has a sleek geometric design, which gives it a contemporary look,
            which would be ideal for my heading and the body of my text. The modern aesthetic of the font is created by
            its balanced letterforms and its versatility, which also maintains a professional look, while Khand has a
            contemporary touch because of its use of clean lines and subtle characters that enhance the modern feel
            without compromising the user's readability. I think using either of these fonts or a combination of both
            will ensure that my website feels aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.

        </div>

        
        <h5>Pros</h5>
        <ul class="design-list">
          <li>
            The website has a clear purpose. The landing page 
            immediately displays the current status of applications, whether 
            they are open or closed. Since applications are closed in this 
            case, they have removed the CTA button “Apply Now," whereas some 
            bursary websites allow you to click an "Apply" button only to then 
            inform you that the bursary is closed.
          </li>
          <li>The website works just as well on mobile, as it is responsive, clear, and easy to follow on mobile devices.</li>
          <li>
            The minimalist design makes navigation simple and allows for quick access to the necessary information
            Page load times are fast
          </li>
          <li>When bursary applications are open, a prominent CTA button like “Apply Now” is displayed.</li>
          <li>The information on the website is well structured with a logical flow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul class="design-list">
          <li>Only “Home” in the navigation bar turns blue when active. The other pages do not 
            indicate the current page you are on. This inconsistency makes navigation less intuitive.
          </li>
          <li>When creating an application, saving options are available. However, when trying to go back and edit 
            certain sections in the application, some information is saved while other details that are typed out 
            are lost, which means the information has to be retyped.
          </li>
          <li>The pop-up  that appears when going onto the login page can be confusing, as there is no close button, 
            and it took me a minute to realise that you need to scroll within the pop-up as there was no direction given.</li>
          </li>

          <li>There is a consistent iconography that uses a gradient style, making them aesthetically pleasing and recognisable</li>

          <li>The website has a minimalist design that improves readability and makes it easy to follow</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul class="design-list">
          <li>The navigation bar does indicate what page you are on.</li>

        <ul class="design-list">
          <li>The load times are fast despite the cluttered pages</li>
          <li>Deals and discounts that are displayed like "ALOT FOR LESS—Save up to 55%" could allow for quick decision when shopping</li>
          <li>Offers a wide range of options, like shopping by brand, category, department, and promotions</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul class="design-list">
          <li>The home page is cluttered. Navigation feels overwhelming, as there are multiple promotional banners across the page</li>
          <li>Multiple CTA buttons, like shop now, are in different colours across different areas of the page this does creates some visual noise</li>
          <li>The lack of whitespace due to the overload of information makes it hard to focus on one thing at a time.</li>
          <li>The department dropdown has a long list, and it is not actually collapsable.</li>
          <li>Too many advertisements across the page are distracting from the core shopping experience</li>
        </ul>
