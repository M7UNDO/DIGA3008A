            <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
            <h4>My target audience</h4>
            <p>
                The target audience for my site includes three key groups. Firstly, potential employers, who are on the 
                website to engage with my past projects and learn about me in order to consider me for professional 
                positions. Second my peers, fellow developers and people within the industry who may be viewing my work 
                for the purpose of potential collaborations or networking opportunities. Lastly users who might be visiting 
                my website seeking some inspiration into my design process.
            </p>
            <h4>My content</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    My home page will serve as the landing page, welcoming users and providing them with a brief introduction of 
                    who I am and guiding them to different sections of my website.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    My portfolio page will be the centrepiece of my website, showcasing my game development projects and artwork.

                </li>
                <li>
                    My design page provides a behind-the-scenes look at my web development process, allowing users to see the 
                    steps I took in planning and building up my website from day one.
                </li>

                    overview into professional background and my expertise. It will also include where I am based and how

            <h4>Likes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The design of the website is sleek and futuristic. The black and white colour palette and the bold 
                    typography give the site a modern look and feel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The use of bold typography on different headings helps the website achieve its strong visual hierarchy. 
                    This contributes to its easy navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The design of the website is very clean and minimalist. It does a good job of avoiding clutter, allowing 
                    the content to stand out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The way in which the designers' skillset has been displayed on the website effectively outlines their range 
                    of skills and projects and showcases the designers' versatility. I think this is a good idea and could attract 
                    potential employers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The way the website makes use of creative typography, such as the fragmented text. This adds an artistic 
                    touch to the design.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Dislikes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The website's design relies heavily on text; there is a lack of imagery. For the design of my website, 
                    I intend to use more images and icons. In this case, however, it does not take away from the website's appeal and impact.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The website's design makes use of a limited colour palette. Although the minimalism is a positive for this 
                    website. Adding some spots of colour could potentially make the website more engaging.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Typography</h4>
            <p>
                I want the typography of my website to have a clean and modern feel. I think this is reflected by my font choices 
                below, which are Montserrat, which has a sleek geometric design, which gives it a contemporary look, which would 
                be ideal for my heading and the body of my text. The modern aesthetic of the font is created by its balanced 
                letterforms and its versatility, which also maintains a professional look, while Khand has a contemporary touch 
                because of its use of clean lines and subtle characters that enhance the modern feel without compromising the 
                user's readability. I think using either of these fonts or a combination of both will ensure that my website 
                feels aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.
            </p>
            <h3>Font Choices</h3>
