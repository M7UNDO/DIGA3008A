            <h4>Likes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The design of the website is sleek and futuristic. The black and white colour palette and the bold 
                    typography give the site a modern look and feel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The use of bold typography on different headings helps the website achieve its strong visual hierarchy. 
                    This contributes to its easy navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The design of the website is very clean and minimalist. It does a good job of avoiding clutter, allowing 
                    the content to stand out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The way in which the designers' skillset has been displayed on the website effectively outlines their range 
                    of skills and projects and showcases the designers' versatility. I think this is a good idea and could attract 
                    potential employers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The way the website makes use of creative typography, such as the fragmented text. This adds an artistic 
                    touch to the design.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Dislikes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The website's design relies heavily on text; there is a lack of imagery. For the design of my website, 
                    I intend to use more images and icons. In this case, however, it does not take away from the website's appeal and impact.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The website's design makes use of a limited colour palette. Although the minimalism is a positive for this 
                    website. Adding some spots of colour could potentially make the website more engaging.
                </li>
            </ul>
