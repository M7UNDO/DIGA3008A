            <p>
              In today's digital world, the quality of a website's User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) play a
              crucial role in the development of digital products, as it directly impacts how users interact and engage
              with them (Hamidli, 2023: 1-3 ). UI refers to the visual and interactive elements that users engage with,
              such as buttons, icons, and the layout, while UX encompasses the broader emotional and cognitive
              experience of using the digital system. These design elements go beyond the functionality and aesthetics,
              as they operate as signs and signifiers, forming a semiotic system that communicates meaning to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              UI and UX do not only guide the user's actions, but they also influence their interpretation, trust and
              perception. Thus, UI and UX are systems of communication, and interaction design becomes a language users
              must read and respond to. Well-designed UI can make a digital product more aesthetically pleasing,
              intuitive and simple to use, while well-designed UX can ensure a more positive experience throughout the
              user's journey on the website. Successful implementation of UI and UX design can directly increase user
              satisfaction, loyalty, and engagement with the digital product (Hamidli, 2023: 1-3 ).
            </p>
            <p>
              Ghanchi notes that the design of a system carries an ethical weight. This means that any product that is
              created embodies a value system, clearly indicating the designer's beliefs and moral principles. Poor or
              manipulative design can exclude, confuse, or even exploit users, while good, ethical design can empower
              them by being inclusive, accessible and transparent with users (Ghanchi: 2021). This is especially vital
              when the digital platform serves a vulnerable user base, such as the National Student Financial Aid Scheme
              (NSFAS). NSFAS was created to offer financial assistance to disadvantaged South African students for their
              tertiary education.
            </p>
            <p>
              This essay critically analyses the NSFAS website through the lenses of UI, UX, ethics and interaction. It
              explores how the website's visual and functional design work have an impact on user trust, inclusion and
              transparency. This analysis also considers the broader socio-political dynamics that may be reflected in
              the interface's structure and limitations. By evaluating whether the platform meets the needs of its
              users, the essay highlights the significance of ethical design in shaping meaningful engagement,
              especially with websites like NSFAS that offer public digital services. <br /><br />
              First, examining the NSFAS website's UI, the website has a clean and simple typography. There is an
              established visual hierarchy that remains consistent across every page, with the headings and body text
              having distinct weights and sizes to distinguish between the content. The clear heading levels, as well as
              the typographic contrast, make the pages easier to scan and understand more efficiently. The left-aligned
              body text enhances readability, especially in large paragraphs or chunks of text. The use of the
              sans-serif font on the headings and the body positively contributes to the website's legibility and
              readability, as the minimalistic letter forms reduce visual clutter, making the content easily digestible.
              However, the website's typography could be improved by using relative units like 'rem' or 'em' instead of
              using absolute units such as 'px' for font sizing, which would be in line with the best industry
              practices, allowing for more responsive typography, one that ensures readability and legibility on both
              desktop and mobile (Iman: 2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              The NSFAS website has a clearly defined colour palette, with its primary palette consisting of white,
              black and different shades of orange. The selection of the colour palette reflects a thoughtful approach
              to maintaining visual coherence and enhancing readability across the page. Additionally, the website
              adheres to web content accessibility contrast guidelines. There is clear contrast between the black text
              and the white background, which supports enhanced readability for users with visual impairments, like
              those with low vision. The different shades of orange have been used as accents to highlight certain
              elements, helping them stand out from the rest of the interface. This contrast remains consistent across
              pages with the black logo and icons also being used against the white background. Moreover, NSFAS's
              website has a clear filled' style for all its icons, creating visual uniformity across the website.
              However, while the icons contribute to its visual consistency, their outdated style could have an impact
              on user perception and would benefit from modernisation, keeping up to date with current UI standards to
              improve the overall visual aesthetic of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              An essential component that the website lacks is responsive design. Navigating through the interface on
              mobile proves to be quite challenging, especially for a digital platform intended to cater to
              disadvantaged students who may not have access to desktops and may primarily access the website on mobile
              phones. While it is technically responsive, there are several layout issues, like certain visual elements
              such as buttons disappearing on the mobile screens and images overlapping buttons, requiring users to
              rotate the device to view these elements and expand the screen size. These issues compromise the website's
              usability and may lead to confusion, delays, or even frustration. Given the significance of accessibility
              and mobile-first design for public-facing services, addressing these shortcomings is crucial to ensuring
              that the website has a user-friendly design that allows users to engage with the platform effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
              Shifting focus to NSFAS's UX design, it is important to consider how users interact with the website
              beyond the visual layout. UX design refers to the process of creating digital products or services that
              offer experiences seamless, intuitive, and meaningful for the user. Taking it a step further Ghanchi
              emphasises ethical UX design involves aligning the digital product with the needs of the global and local
              communities, considering economies, politics, and public health (Ghanchi: 2021). In this sense, UX is also
              about how design decisions affect the lives and access of the real users. On this note, the key UX
              principles of usability and inclusion on NSFAS's website can be called into question, as creating an
              application on the platform is not as straightforward as it should be. One of the primary contributors to
              this issue is the website's oversimplification of options during the application process. While
              simplifying options is usually intended to reduce cognitive load, as recommended by Hick's Law in this
              case, it results in an experience that is more restrictive and exclusionary rather than supportive.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, in the course selection section of their website, the menus provided present a limited set
              of choices, with an observable bias towards STEM courses. Options for specific courses such as a Bachelor
              of Arts in Digital Arts are not present in the course selection menu, whereas more detailed options are
              available for STEM courses. Instead, users are limited to broad categories like Film and Arts and Design
              and Construction, lacking specificity that forces the applicants to select a category that may not reflect
              their actual qualification accurately. This kind of design decision can lead to a sense of uncertainty,
              misclassification or incorrect data submissions, which negatively impact usability and accuracy during
              this process. From a UX lens this reflects a lack of contextual awareness and suggests a one-size-fits-all
              approach that may not necessarily align with the nuanced structure of higher education. A more
              user-centric approach would include dynamic forms, explanatory fields like background and more
              representative dropdowns to ensure that all users can engage with the website fairly and effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, this can be observed in the website's enforcement of a fixed household income threshold as a
              requirement of eligibility for funding. This section of the page does not allow applicants to elaborate on
              complex financial circumstances, such as single-parent households, multiple dependants, or informal income
              sources. It only asks for the applicant's household income and nothing more, overlooking and excluding
              students who may be in complex financial situations, thereby limiting the platform's inclusivity and
              sensitivity to diverse user circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Transparency is a key principle of UX that refers to how clearly a system communicates its processes,
              requirements and outcomes to its users (Geyser 2025: 11). In the context of NSFAS's website, transparency
              is essential due to its platform and the website's high-stakes nature, as it essentially governs access to
              financial aid for students all across the country. However, there are several aspects of the user
              experience that raise some concerns about their level of transparency. For example, the application
              tracking feature often lacks detailed updates, leaving users in the dark, as they may see a generic
              progress bar or broad terms like “pending” or “in progress” on their applications without explanation or
              guides on the steps that are being taken, what documentation is missing, or how long the process will
              take. This lack of transparency often leads to a lot of uncertainty, repeated enquiries or missed
              deadlines for users. In fact, the absence of detailed feedback may resemble a dark pattern in terms of how
              it withholds key information from users, making the users rely on external support channels to understand
              what their status means. Implementing a more transparent design would not only improve clarity, but it
              would also establish some trust and confidence from users. Websites like NSFAS that serve public needs
              should provide clear, accessible language and criteria that allow their users to track the progress of
              their applications in detail, offering timely feedback throughout the process. NSFAS would benefit from
              implementing more specific status indicators, contextual help prompts, and a more detailed policy that
              supports transparency and user autonomy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accessibility and inclusion are some other essential principles of UX design that ensure that the product
              or service is usable by everyone. The design should be accessible and provide an equal experience for all
              users. The NSFAS website does not offer any multilingual support. This limits its accessibility to users
              who may not be proficient in English. Examining this through the lens of accessibility proves that it
              restricts comprehension, leading to an increase in cognitive load as well as some misinterpretation of key
              information in some cases. Through the lens of inclusion, it simply fails to acknowledge the country's
              linguistic diversity, reinforcing a system of inequality in terms of access to education-related services.
              The best practice in this case would be including more languages or, at the very least, having the
              availability of core instruction and help resources in any of South Africa's 11 languages. This would
              support equity and usability , as users from different backgrounds would have the same access, and no one
              would be disadvantaged by the system's design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interaction is a critical component of UX that focuses on how users engage with the digital product
              through interactive elements like buttons, menus, forms and animations. It focuses on ensuring that user
              actions lead to predictable and meaningful outcomes as well as visual and tactical responses, which is
              central to interaction design. Successful interaction design can enhance usability, guide the user's
              behaviour, and maintain engagement and interest throughout the user's journey on the website. The
              navigation bar on the NSFAS website demonstrates a thoughtful approach to user interaction. The website
              includes hover effects that provide immediate visual feedback when a user moves their cursor over menu
              items, buttons, and icons. The navigation bar also features auto-expanding submenu options that enable
              users to navigate to further categories without needing to click through multiple layers and pages,
              contributing positively to the user's experience on the website. However, a usability challenge with the
              navigation bar is how the navigation menu does not indicate what page the user is on. This can confuse
              users or cause them to make errors, especially those who do not have much digital experience. This issue
              is further compounded on mobile devices with the misalignment of interactive elements such as buttons that
              disappear, meaning that performing the website's core action, like filling out a form or uploading
              documents, requires extra effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the analysis of the NSFAS website reveals how UI and UX design decisions can significantly
              impact user experience and trust, as well as accessibility. The NSFAS website demonstrates some strength
              in terms of visual clarity through its consistent typography and use of colour contrast. However, these
              are undermined by the website's outdated icons and lack of mobile responsiveness. These issues complicate
              navigation and usability, especially for users with limited digital access. From a UX lens, the
              oversimplification of options restricts course categories and lacks space for users with complex financial
              circumstances, limiting inclusivity as well as user agency. Moreover, the absence of transparency in the
              application tracking process and the lack of multilingual support further highlight how NSFAS's website
              fails to accommodate its core user and its diverse needs. The findings in this analysis demonstrate that
              UI and UX are not just technical features but powerful communicative tools that shape user experience and
              convey institutional values. A platform like NSFAS, whose purpose is to support disadvantaged students,
              and addressing these design issues would ensure fair, accessible, and ethical engagement.
