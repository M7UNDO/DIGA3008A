            <p>
              In the digital age, internet access is no longer a luxury but a necessity for full participation within a
              society, enabling coordination, the exchange of information and even survival (Kasapis, 2021). The
              internet is not only a communication medium but also a geopolitical tool, and beneath the assurances of
              universal access and decentralised networks exists an infrastructure that is increasingly controlled by
              private entities, whose actions extend much beyond just business interests. This has never been more
              evident than in the recent geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, where US-based company
              SpaceX, headed by Elon Musk played a significant role in shaping the course of war and diplomacy through
              the deployment of Starlink, the largest satellite mega-constellation globally, delivering Internet service
              to remote regions.
            </p>
            <p>
              While initially Starlink received praise and functioned as lifeline for Ukraine offering critical
              infrastructure in a crisis, the involvement of a private corporation in warfare have raised concerns about
              digital coloniality, where colonial power structures are being replicated by the technological dominance
              of Western entities.
            </p>
            <p>
              This essay critically examines the intersections between internet governance, geopolitical power, and
              digital coloniality through the case study of SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service in Ukraine
              between 2022 and 2024. By drawing on theories of digital geography as well as political economy this essay
              highlights how Starlink's intervention represents a paradigm shift in the way that digital infrastructure
              serving as both a tool of resistance and a means of neo-colonial domination. The analysis identifies key
              aspects of transformation which include: the privatisation of essential communication infrastructures in
              areas of conflict, the rise of corporate entities as geopolitical decision makers and the perpetuation of
              colonial power dynamic through technological dependence.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022 created demand for communication networks due to
              Russia disabling Ukrainian infrastructure through targeted assaults and cyberattacks. This left the
              Ukrainian government grappling with damaged infrastructure and disrupted communication. Following this, a
              decisive contribution that garnered a lot of publicity came from SpaceX, as Elon Musk announced on Twitter
              that Starlink would be made across Ukraine (Musk : 2022). In the following months Starlink was activated,
              and thousands of terminals across the country were deployed to support connectivity for the military,
              emergency services, and civilians (Abels 2024: 843). This intervention by the private sector filled a
              critical gap when the state and international responses received proved to be inadequate. Starlink
              provided encrypted, high-speed internet connectivity and quickly became a crucial tool for the Ukrainian
              military and government, making it indispensable as a communications infrastructure for the Ukrainian
              military (Jordan, 2023).
            </p>

            <p>
              Bojor, Petrache and Cristescu (2024) note, by May 2022, over 150,000 Ukrainians were using Starlink on a
              daily basis. These terminals also assist in enabling a range of military applications, which include
              gathering intelligence, battle coordination and drone operations. This made Starlink an essential tool for
              operational efficiency and boosting morale between troops and their families, even under siege like in
              Mariupol's Azovstal plant (Bojor, Petrache and Cristescu, 2024).
            </p>

            <p>
              What first seemed like an act of solidarity revealed its true intentions over time. In 2023 Musk revealed
              that he had refused a Ukrainian request to activate Starlink over Crimea, essentially preventing a drone
              strike on the Russian navy. This revelation proved that SpaceX engineers were making real time battlefield
              decisions about service availability, essential granting a private corporation veto power over military
              operations. This is an example of data colonialism where technological dependence creates a new form of
              extractive control. Musk's justification was that compliance would have made SpaceX explicitly complicit
              in the major war (Jordan, 2023). This unilateral decision shaped military strategy without the oversight
              of the state, demonstrating a private corporation exercising strategic autonomy and reconfiguring state
              business relations and positioning themselves as geopolitical actors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Abels suggests that multinational corporations like SpaceX do not only function as commercial actors but
              also as geopolitical actors. This means their infrastructure control equates to political power. Their
              decision-making initially revolves around supplying critical infrastructure and later placing conditions
              on its use. This reveals a logic that is not entirely subordinate to state interests, but rather it
              represents a form of infrastructural power that intersects with global capital and strategic diplomacy
              (Abel, 2024).
            </p>

            <p>
              Starlink's dual-use nature, used as both civilian infrastructure and a military asset, emphasised concerns
              of digital coloniality, as the dependency of a sovereign nation like Ukraine on a US-based corporation
              suggests an asymmetrical power relationship. In this case, digital coloniality emerges through
              technological dependence. This dynamic also undermines the principles of internet governance which are
              premised on state sovereignty. Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb (2018) explain that the geography of
              internet infrastructure can exacerbate regional disparities. However, Starlink's orbital architecture
              bypasses terrestrial, allowing SpaceX to dictate its terms of use globally, essentially reshaping the
              political geography of cyberspace (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018).
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, this dynamic undermines the principles of internet governance premised on state sovereignty
              and multilateralism. As Greenstein et al. (2018) demonstrate, the geography of internet infrastructure can
              exacerbate regional disparities. Starlink's orbital architecture bypasses terrestrial jurisdiction,
              allowing SpaceX to dictate terms of access globally, effectively reshaping the political geography of
              cyberspace.
            </p>

            <p>
              The intervention of Starlink in Ukraine challenges long-standing models of internet governance, which were
              rooted in cooperative, multi-stakeholder approaches. Although it is decentralised, its privately owned
              nature makes it difficult to regulate, while granting a great deal of control to its operator. Musk's
              frequent policy announcements on X (formerly Twitter) exemplify a form of “Twitter diplomacy”, where
              public and geopolitical decisions are made outside of formal channels and institutions” (Duncombe, 2017).
            </p>
            <p>
              This shift raises profound ethical questions: Should a private company have the authority to decide the
              limits of military operations? What mechanisms exist to ensure accountability? These questions highlight
              the absence of existing internet governance frameworks to address the realities of privatised satellite
              constellations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response to these vulnerabilities, states and international bodies have begun to reassert control. The
              EU's IRIS2 and China's Guowang constellations represent attempts at being autonomous. Meanwhile the US has
              chosen to deepen their public-private partnerships with SpaceX, revealing the difficulty liberal
              democracies face when it comes to severing ties from dominant tech corporations (Abels, 2024). Recent
              developments highlight the fragility of this arrangement. On June 5, 2025, following his departure from
              DOGE and amid a feud with Donald Trump, Musk tweeted that SpaceX would immediately start decommissioning
              its Dragon spacecraft after Trump threatened to cancel his government contracts. Although he did reverse
              the decision hours later (Dinner, 2025). This instance highlights how tightly linked private corporations
              are with national concerns and this also reveals how volatile these ties can be, in situations like these
              where political disruption emerge. It raises the question about the risk of outsourcing critical
              infrastructure to private entities as their decisions could be influenced by their personal or corporate
              interests rather than national stability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukraine remains in a vulnerable position, as it is still dependent on Starlink for its communications
              infrastructure, so it is still subject to its limitations. This further highlight the broader trend of
              private tech firm managing access to digital goods, essentially acting as gatekeepers to sovereignty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other countries have responded differently, for instance South Africa, which has notably declined
              licencing Starlink in the country. According to ICASA this decision was made based on SpaceX's refusal to
              comply with countries BBBEE requirement, that mandate 30% ownership to locally historically disadvantaged
              persons (Crouth, 2024). Moreover, the concerns about Starlink go beyond local licensing, and operating
              without physical presence in the country. It also speaks to the assertion of nation sovereignty over
              digital infrastructure and highlights the increasing awareness among countries from the Global South in
              understanding the risk associated with unregulated Western technological dominance.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, this essay has critically examined how SpaceX's intervention of Starlink in Ukraine
              represents an intersection of internet governance, geopolitical power, and digital coloniality. By framing
              the analysis through theories of digital geography and political economy, this case reveals some of the
              ways in which digital infrastructure can serve as both a tool of resistance and hope but also a vehicle
              for neo-colonial influence. The role of Starlink, which went from supporting communication during a time
              of crisis to imposing unilateral decisions, perfectly illustrates the risks that are associated with
              privatised infrastructure, especially in conflict zones.
