            <p>
              Reflecting on the development of my website over the past few weeks, I feel that I have made significant
              progress and achieved most of the goals I set out at the beginning of the process. I've established a good
              base for future websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most notable improvements I made was expanding on my portfolio by including and showcasing my
              3D models. I felt this was a necessary step to level up my portfolio page. While my game development
              projects demonstrated many of my skills, they didn't fully represent the range of my abilities. I also
              recognised that not every user who is viewing my portfolio would want to download and play a game so
              including interactive 3D models which users can pan, move, rotate and zoom enhances the user experience by
              making the viewing process more engaging and memorable. Although I have expanded my portfolio page, I do
              see room to develop it furthering by adding my logo designs and digital art projects
            </p>
            <p>
              Another key enhancement was implementing a light and dark mode toggle that persists across pages. This
              enhances both my user interface and overall user experience by offering visual comfort to users and also
              maintains consistency and personalisation throughout their experience on my website. I also focused on
              accessibility by adding a modal box for opening and viewing images, allowing users to click on images and
              view larger versions, improving readability. Additionally, I improved the descriptive quality of alt text
              and used aria labels for elements with no visible text but needs a description for screen readers to pick
              up.
            </p>

            <p>
              My folder structure is consistent across my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of my file and folder names
              begin with a lowercase letter, to promote clean organisation. I also made sure to use my semantic mark-up
              correctly, paying special attention to the context and meaning of each tag. Each of my pages are divided
              into &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt, &lt;footer&gt; My header contains my &lt;nav&gt; and navigation bar, my
              main contains the content divided into &lt;sections&gt; and &lt;articles&gt; were appropriate (e.g inside
              the &lt;main&gt; tag of my blog posts the content is wrapped in an &lt;article&gt;).
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of meta data, I have implemented it and applied it across my pages. This includes meta data such
              as such as the author, page description, and Open Graph tags for an enhance look on when shared on social
              media platforms. This improves SEO and also supports accessibility tools and usability.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also converted all my CSS units to rem, based on a root font size of 62.5% (1rem =10px), to enhanced
              scalability and make my styles easier to manage. All of my pages have responsive layouts that adjust well
              to different types of screen sizes such as laptops, tablets and phones. I've also resolved the overflow
              problems that affected smaller screens.
            </p>

            <p>
              To optimise my code, I cleaned up unnecessary repetition and applied more global code where it was
              necessary. I removed duplicate styling in my CSS and also moved away from redundant functions in my
              JavaScript, for example, I had previously created multiple versions of a load() function in my earlier
              versions. I also complied with good practices like separating concerns, as there is no inline styling or
              JavaScript logic in my HTML. Any dynamic styling in my JavaScript is limited to user triggered
              interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              One highlight for me was using an asynchronous function to fetch data from an API integrated into my
              website. This API generates inspirational quotes and wisdom, adding an engaging element to the site that
              personalises the user's experience and could potentially encourage more visits
            </p>

            <p>
              Interactive elements on my website further showcase my growing JavaScript skillset. For example, the event
              handling game containers when the user hover over the project (mouseover), a short gameplay clip
              dynamically replaces the image src. I also make use of window events like load and use DOM to manipulate
              and to control the visibility and stylling of certain elements. Additionally, I implemented an
              IntersectionObserver to track section visibility and highlight the corresponding navigation links,
              enhancing user navigation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reflecting on the development process, I'm proud of my website and how it is in alignment with my design
              process and intentions. It does a good job at communicating who I am as a designer, showcasing my work,
              and providing a platform. The process of developing of my website has deepened my understanding of web
              design and given me a good base in user-centred design that I can continue to build on.
