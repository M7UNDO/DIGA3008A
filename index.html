    <h2>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages</h2>
    <p>Since I had already used GitHub before, setting up and publishing to GitHub was a straightforward process for me,<br> as I quickly familiarised myself with everything and was able to push my website without much of a hassle.</p>
    <h1>Reflection on the readings I selectedâ€”relating it to your experience with the internet today</h1>
    <p>My chosen reading, The Library of Babel imagined a universe containing every book in the world, whether meaningful or not.
    <br> Today, that universe fits in my pocket; my smartphone gives me access to infinite knowledge at the click of a button.
    <br> The search for truth in Borges' The Library of Babel mirrors how I interact with the internet on a daily basis. However, there is one key difference. Instead of wandering through endless hexagonal rooms, I simply tap on a screen, 
         and my phone connects me to nearly all recorded human knowledge. Whether I'm Googling for academic sources, checking and scrolling social media, or using AI for quick summaries, my phone functions as my own personal library.
        <br> Today we are constantly bombarded with information, but in Borges' time, seeking knowledge was a slow and painstaking process (Borges, 2013).</p>
        <p>The irony of having infinite information at my fingertips doesn't always translate to a deeper understanding. In the same way that Borges' librarians searched for a book that could explain everything, I do the same when I use Google to find answers.
        <br>However, in a world where any information I am searching for is readily available, the true skill isn't just searching but knowing what to trust, what to question, and when to take a break from the never-ending flow of information.</p>
